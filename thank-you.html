            <p>Someone from the community will review your job and publish it as soon as possible in the <a href="http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/">jobs website</a></p>
            <p>If your job is approved and added to our jobs page, a <a href="https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/">community forum</a> post is automatically created for your job - please be sure to check on the forum post associated with your job as many designers ask questions and put themselves forward within the forum. </p>
            <p>In the meantime, you can:</p>

            <h3>What actually happens (gory details)</h3>
            <p>Submitting a job sends a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesign/jobs#jobs">Open Source Design jobs repository</a>. Someone needs to merge the pull request. Merging triggers the publication to the Open Source design <a href="http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/">jobs website</a></p>
