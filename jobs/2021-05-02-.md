It's been a while since I started developing OpenAPI Mocker.
It all started as a personal side-project, then we started to use it at work and recently caught the attention of many people as users and as contributors.

So I think it's time to give some love to this project in the form of visual improvement, including a logo, a brand-new documentation site (already working on it using docusaurus), and who knows what else.

But as I have absolutely zero design skills, here I am asking for someone that would like to help me with their contributions.

Thanks.
Joaqu√≠n.
