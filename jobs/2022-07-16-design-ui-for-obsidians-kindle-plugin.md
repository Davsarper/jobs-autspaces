Kindle Highlights is a very popular plugin that allows a user to sync their book highlights from their Kindle into Obsidian - a very popular note taking app that empowers people to connect their ideas and build a second brain.

I would love to upgrade this experience for our users by looking at a creative way of allowing users to easily showcase their books and highlights, and any interesting insights (e.g. book with most highlights)
