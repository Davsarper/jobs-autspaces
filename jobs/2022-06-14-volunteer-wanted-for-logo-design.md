Hi all,

Open Source Gardens is a project to promote the use of open source seeds, the project provides free seeds to people in spring and also information on how to save the seeds so people become independent. The projects has also a community garden in Berlin where people get together to grow their seeds.

There is a logo draft here:https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/opensourcedesign/original/2X/0/0399c3a8c4ef0b0db05f7a05a8553695d06ba36d.png

Perhaps someone would like to help us out with a nice svg version that looks more polished and professional. :smiley:

The yellow is meant to be a dandelion, thereâ€™s a sun and technology element, the colours, and composition could be changed, the dandelion would be the focus in terms of element to keep.
