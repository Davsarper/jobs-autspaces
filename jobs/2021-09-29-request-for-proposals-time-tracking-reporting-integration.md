Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is looking to engage the services of an individual with expertise in developing integrations with QuickBooks, HOT’s accounting software. Currently, HOT is utilizing BambooHR, Gusto, and Papaya Global to track staff time each month, including hours worked, projects/donors billed to, leave time, etc. As each of these systems has an open API, we’d like an individual to develop integrations with each to QuickBooks. This will eliminate the need for our accounting team to pull and merge time tracking reports manually each month with each system.
