InvenTree is an open-source PLM (parts libary managment) with a backend API server, a frontend based on Bootstrap/jquery /JS-based frontend and several apps.
We are rewriting the frontend based on React and want to take this opportunity to create a more user-friendly, intuitive and accessible experience for everyone.

Major pain points are:
- Navigation between pages
- Information-dense but readable tables
- Introducing users to functions, communicating restrictions and possible actions

The credentials for the demo can be found here: https://inventree.org/demo, the current state of the new UI is accessible [here](https://demo.inventree.org/platform/)

A designer already did some groundwork and we have some great mockups (figma) available, he had to reallocate his free time. We have coders on the team so getting designs/behaviours built once they are conceptualised should not be a problem - you do not need to know how to code.
