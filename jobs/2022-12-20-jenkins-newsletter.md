Jenkins is an open source automation server, it is used by millions of users around the world. A few months ago we started the monthly Jenkins Newsletter. We don't have access to a design team and as you can see our newsletter headline design is quite generic and boring. Oleg Nenashev suggested that we reach out to you for your contribution to our newsletter design.

Our newsletter is published via a blog, so we only need the headline design. No template is needed.

This design is needed for end of year recap newsletter which we hope to publish the first week of Jan 2023. So we would like this design to be different (special) from a design that we would use for the rest of the year

If at all possible we will need another design that we could use from Feb - Dec 2023.
