title: UI/UX Design Global Rework
role: 'Web design,UI design,UX design'
compensation: gratis
deliverables: "I'm looking for a global design improvement (change of logo, whole website design) and a more specific UX design rework on the different features of the system :\r\n* Main participants form\r\n* Organizer panel with participants details and different actions like downloading the list, withdrawing a participant, etc\r\n* Participant panel with mailing system to contact the secret santa and potentially in the future contacting also the target\r\n\r\nFuture features I'm looking help for, all of those I'm not sure how to make them clear and simple and not create an ununderstandable monster :\r\n* I want to add a new possibility in the participants form to create groups to simply exclude whole groups instead of only individual participants, useful for huge groups.\r\n* I want to add a new possibility in the participant form the possibility to contact their target with predefined messages to keep the secret. People already mismatch the santa and their target and use the form to contact their santa in order to contact their target so I'm really afraid of how to make this understandable.\r\n* I want to add a new possibility in the draw creation to specify that participants don't know each other so there's no actual secret. Thus allowing the santa to freely contact their target without having to use predefined messages.\r\n* I'd like to add the possibility for each participants to have several targets, with the previous features, I'm afraid it will become a nightmare to use.\r\n* Lastly, I'd like to let the organizer add new participants in an already running event thus adding the possibility to redraw the targets for some willing participants."

SecretSanta.fr is a webtool to help anyone simply organize a secretsanta event with participants, exclusions (people you won't pick) and mailing system to contact your secret santa without knowing who they are. It's an open source project I develop for 7 years (December 1st, 2015) as a side project.
I really want this tool to be simple of usage but with more and more features and things goes on, I really need help designing the UI to prevent misunderstanding of some new interesting features.
Moreover, the global design of the app is just a standard template bought online with some image swap and is really not that good.
