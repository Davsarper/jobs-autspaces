About
Co-op Cloud is a software stack that aims to make hosting libre software applications simple for small service providers such as tech co-operatives who are looking to standardise around an open, transparent and scalable infrastructure. It uses the latest container technologies and configurations are shared into the commons for the benefit of all. 

The Job
Co-op Cloud is looking to print some stickers to take to events, we were thinking on die cut style stickers but also perhaps printing some round ones too.
