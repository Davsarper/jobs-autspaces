Window.js is an open-source Javascript runtime for desktop graphics programming.

It allows running graphical Javascript applications outside of the browser. For example, it supports running p5js on the desktop.

The project doesn't have a logo yet, and its main website could also use some design input! (e.g. better layout, better color pallete, etc.)

I'm looking for open-source contributors to help with the design aspects of this project. The first thing I'm looking for is a logo.

If you'd like to contribute then get involved in the GitHub Discussions forum for the project, or via the mailing list:
