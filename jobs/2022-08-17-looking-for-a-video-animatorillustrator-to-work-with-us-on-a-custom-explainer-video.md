Owncast is a free and open source piece of software to allow individuals and organizations to run their own live video streams, similar to Twitch or YouTube Live.

We're looking to create an animated explainer video that's approximately 1 minute long with animation that gives a brief overview of Owncast, what it is, and who it's useful for.

The style will be 2D with some amount of custom illustration. An example video of something similar is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSbNdBmWKE

We have a script written already, but of course can make changes.

Please have some examples of previous explainer videos you've worked on.  Looking forward to meeting you!
