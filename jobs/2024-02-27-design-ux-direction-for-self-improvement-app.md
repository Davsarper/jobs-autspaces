The mission of tapas.fit is to make self-improvement accessible and free to all, via a free database and open source mobile app.
See the website for more information.
This is an open source project. The coding part is being handled, but i'm looking for a person (or people) with UX & design expertise who believe in the mission / are willing to contribute.
