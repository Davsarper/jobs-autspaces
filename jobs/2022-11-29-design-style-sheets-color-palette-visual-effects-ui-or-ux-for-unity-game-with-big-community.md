UltraStar Play took on the legacy of a popular singing game from the last decade. The gameplay has aged well but visually there is room for improvement.

The game is created with the Unity game engine. The Unity "UI Toolkit" uses style sheets (subset of CSS), and XML layout (similar to HTML).

From color palettes, over visual effects and graphic assets, to a more thought-out UI, contributions are welcome.
