Help Antennapod understand their varied user behaviours around managing podcast episodes and offer improvement suggestion based on user research and insight.
User flows would be useful for understanding the in-depth user needs. Helping define user stories from user research and user flows. The team have some assumptions and hypotheses to validate through user research and need support making user research manageable and implementable.
