pip is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes. pip has never had a dedicated identity or logo, but the pip team would love to have a stronger visual identity and brand.

To help inform this, we ran a survey in Fall of 2020 to get community input into the identity of pip. Here are some of the survey findings to help guide logo & identity ideas:

### Overall:

- A balance of youthfulness (27.5%) and maturity (25.1%)
- Playful (31.5%) over sophisticated (20.3%)
- Abstract (34.9%) over literal (18.5%)

### How do you view pip?

- "A peppy and very smol animal (intentionally spelling small as 'smol' because memes). Maybe a big-eyed baby snake? Maybe a cute koala or something with a snake wrapped around its ankle?" 
- "an eight-armed raccoon (or other beastie who's inclined to grab stuff)?"
- Some say there is no need to present pip as a person or an animal, object is a better choice.
