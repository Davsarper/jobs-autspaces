We seek a self-motivated visual designer who can 1) study the existing landscape of communication material and develop a cohesive visual design system that be used and scaled up by non-designers 2) work with a diverse interdisciplinary team to help them communicate ideas visually 3) maintain strong design sensibilities even under tight time constraints and 4) maintain clarity in their work while working independently and juggling between multiple projects at once.
