Schrödinger Hat is an open-source community. Our mission is to share the love for open-source!

We are a community of volunteers, so we need someone who can help us by leading the design of the community.

We are seeking help with the design of the social media as we are organizing events, podcasts, and many other things so we must produce different social messages.

It would be nice to have some skills in designing logos. as we may create new projects within the community
