title: Logo/icons for Monado XR (VR/AR) Runtime
role: Logo design & branding
compensation: paid
deliverables: "- A logo (in SVG) in both a full-color and single-color (mono/black-and-white) version. Should be suitable for use:\r\n  - web branding\r\n  - marketing slides, brochures, etc.\r\n  - as part of Android app icon, notification icon\r\n  - on a \"hexie\" (hexagonal sticker)\r\n- Preferably with color suggestions, and ideally open-source font suggestions (in some places we'll presumably have the logo next to the word Monado)\r\n- We'd be really excited if there was a clear way to create a 3D model equivalent of it. That would be useful in 3D UI stuff.\r\n\r\nThe results will be licensed as a part of the Monado project."

Monado is an open-source runtime, focused on implementing the Khronos OpenXR standard in a fully open-source, permissively-licensed project. The project was founded by Collabora, so in some places (e.g. Khronos slide decks) the project gets represented by a Collabora logo right now, which isn't great since we want it to be independent.

Right now we're using a variety of placeholders for the logo (in some places a silly photo of a dog wearing an HMD, in others a sketch proposed by one of our devs) but as we're approaching a 1.0 "conformant" release we'd like to get something properly done.

It should stand out, look sleek/futuristic, and also not be tied to a specific tech (head-mounted displays, etc) since wide-ranging hardware support and future development is anticipated. The payment is being funded by Collabora's marketing department, so it should be marketing-friendly and appealing, of course.

Of course, as part of the Monado project, involvement is subject to the FreeDesktop.org code of conduct: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado#contributing-code-of-conduct>

I brain-dumped some key points the logo might flow from below.


- Monado (name has no inherent meaning or relation to any other thing named Monado) is an open-source virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR/XR) runtime/system.
  - A community project founded and supported by Collabora.
  - Hosted under the freedesktop.org umbrella
- Open source
  - "free as in freedom"
  - modifiable
  - flexible
  - public
  - community
- VR/AR/XR
  - Reality
  - Simulation
  - graphics rendering
  - interaction
  - Is an OpenXR runtime - so see their materials for inspiration as well https://www.khronos.org/openxr/  - note the X is a V and A stacked (x is a placeholder, not an initial)
    - especially the "tshirt design"
  - do **not** focus on current hardware (e.g. headsets)
  - expanding reality
  - "unbounded"
  - concepts to consider:
    - grids
    - triangle "meshes"
    - 3D solids
    - 3D coordinate axes
    - X-Y-Z (conventionally associated with R-G-B respectively, and in OpenXR, x is right, y is up, and z is out of the screen toward you.)
- Compatibility: intended to work on a wide range of devices and systems
  - unifying
  - universal
