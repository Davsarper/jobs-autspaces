AuthPass is a cross platform, open source password manager. It is already pretty full featured, but the UX can be a bit rough at times. One main usability problem is the actual "password entry" because it is pretty flexible. It has a basic set of "fields" but can be extended to include custom fields. There also a few different types of fields (plain text, passwords, TOTP).

Right now it is the same UI for viewing and editing. Which is imho nice and if possible something to keep. But users are sometimes irritated and fearful of modifying their passwords while viewing, which could be a point to improve upon.
