We are building an app named **sk8**, for skaters, so they can find, add, rate and comment the best skate spots in the city. The app will be available on Android, iOS, and in a web browser. Free to use for everyone. Currently, there are 4 developers actively working on it. The project is open-source. We suck at design and seeking for help.

You would have to design a mobile app from scratch. If you find this idea interesting and would like to be a part of it, reach out to us on Discord: https://discord.gg/ge2Vj8kxCZ
