Hello 👋,

My team and I are looking for someone that can contribute to the user experience of [RestQA](https://restqa.io).

### THE PRODUCT 💻

RestQA is a test automation tool, which is very tedious and time consuming. The reality is developers and/or QA trend to drag their feet on test automation creation. 😢

### THE VISION 🚀

This is why our mission with RestQA is to make test automation fun 🤓! We are dreaming about using gamification patterns and a nice user experience to make people enjoy building tests.

### THE BACKGROUND 💬

As tech people we already work on the foundation but  the product has a lack in UX and would love if an expert contribute.

### THE CORE TEAM 👩‍💻

* [WAPI](https://github.com/restqa-bot) - Our mascot
* [OLIVIER] (https://github.com/olivierodo) - Main maintainer 
* [TONY] (https://github.com/tony-go) - Tech lead 
* [KAT] (https://github.com/KaTLaz) - content manager - Non tech 🙃


### ABOUT YOU 🦸‍♀️

If you are a UX lover that's all what we need, it doesn't matter what is your expertise, your background, your tech skill. It's all about sharing and growing all together with the product 🤩. You can contribute as much or as little as you want, no hassle. FOSS 🧡.

>  Feel free to reach me out if you are interested or if you just want to chat ☕️.
