Hi ðŸ‘‹,
Our small community project is about to get gamified. After doing some research with our UX designer contributor we are ready to start building our gamification flow.
We are not looking at someone that will just do some task, we are looking at someone that willing to contribute and share idea with the different contributors in order to have a full benefit of a shared knowledge.
