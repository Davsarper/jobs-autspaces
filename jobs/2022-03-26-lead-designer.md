We are building an open education platform for lifelong learners!

This is an ideal job for someone passionate about education, learning and open source software, but also for someone looking to take a lead design role and have a lot of ownership over the design directions of our learning platform. 

You should have a modern, high-level aesthetic and obviously great creative skills and be able to work hand-in-hand with the rest of a really passionate team. This is a group of volunteers though, so we are also looking for someone who can enjoy the experience and wants to help make education better for the world. 

## Responsibilities

* Set design standards on concepts, layouts, mockups, product ui and ux and branding
* Communicate and collaborate on product design and strategy in the product design team.
* Tackle complex design challenges with energy and enthusiasm
* Be able to have fun with us and enjoy pushing the bar a little bit on learning and education
